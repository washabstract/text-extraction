               5.2. Bring California Home Act13050. This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the Bring California Home Act.13051. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a) Homelessness is solvable, and the state has a role to play in rendering homelessness rare, brief, and nonrecurring. In fact, national and other state experiences show that jurisdictions at every level, including homeless continuums of care, cities, counties, and the state, must collaborate to achieve advances in reducing and ultimately solving homelessness.(b) In January 2019, an estimated 151,278 people experienced homelessness in California at a single point in time, as reported by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is the highest number since 2007, and represented a 17-percent increase since 2018.
        Experts predict significant increases in homelessness in 2021 resulting from the COVID-19 economic downturn. (c) African Americans are disproportionately represented among California’s homeless population. While 6.5 percent of Californians identify as Black or African American, almost 40 percent of the state’s homeless population is African American. The rate of homelessness among African Americans is almost twice the rates of poverty among African Americans. Similarly, indigenous populations are over six times more likely to experience homelessness than the general population. (d) Latinx Californians are least likely to access housing and services available in their communities. (e) Women have unique precursors and experiences
        of homelessness. Domestic violence is a primary cause of homelessness for women, and women are more likely to experience domestic violence, sexual assault, and exploitation once they become homeless. Domestic violence is also a common experience and cause of homelessness among families, youth, and people who identify as transgender. Survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and exploitation are typically underserved in our homeless systems.(f) Research suggests homeless populations are at far greater risk for consequences of COVID-19. Early studies estimated people experiencing homelessness are two to three times as likely to die from COVID-19 than the general population. COVID-19 is putting pressure on local homeless systems to open safe sites for people to shelter, in noncongregant settings, to avoid the spread of COVID-19. (g) Due to the
        economic impacts of COVID-19, researchers estimate significant increases in homelessness.(h) COVID-19 has also resulted in increased rates of domestic violence, putting pressure on domestic violence response systems to ensure safe housing for survivors.(i) People living on the streets typically resided in a surrounding neighborhood prior to falling into homelessness. As examples, 70 percent of the people experiencing homelessness in the City and County of San Francisco lived in the city before becoming homeless and only 8 percent came from out of state; about 75 percent of the homeless population of the County of Los Angeles lived in the region before becoming homeless; and 73 percent of people experiencing homelessness in the County of Tehama were living in the county before becoming homeless.(j) Homelessness
        often results from institutionalization, and homelessness often also causes a cycle of institutionalization that generates significant public sector costs. Reversing a cycle of institutionalization and homelessness requires collaboration between the state, local governments, and the private sector, including collaboration to prevent discharges from institutional settings into homelessness.(k) Almost 30 years of studies consistently prove housing affordable to people experiencing homelessness and without limits on length of stay, referred to as permanent housing, allows people to exit homelessness and remain stably housed. Recent experiences with investment in permanent housing for veterans shows we can reduce homelessness significantly with appropriate levels of investment in permanent housing. Evidence further shows people cannot recover from a serious mental illness, a substance use disorder, or a chronic medical condition, or reduce their
        rate or incidence of incarceration, hospitalization, or institutionalization, unless and until housed.(l) People who move from homelessness to permanent housing are able to reduce the overall costs of public services. Randomized, control-group studies, including studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, show that housing with services allows formerly homeless people with serious mental illness to reduce their Medicaid and justice-system costs, often equivalent to the costs of housing and services. Providing housing to people experiencing homelessness is also shown to reduce local and state jurisdictions’ expenditures on public safety, health care, and sanitation.(m) By creating a Bring California Home Fund, it is the intent of the Legislature to make homelessness rare, brief, and nonrecurrent. Toward this end, it is the intent of the Legislature to
        create a subsidy program to fill gaps within state’s response to homelessness, scale evidence-based solutions while promoting innovation to move people quickly into permanent housing, eliminate racial and gender disparities in who becomes homeless and who is able to access housing and housing-based services, establish greater flexibility and a more nimble process in implementing a comprehensive response to homelessness, facilitate critically needed collaboration between different levels of government, align housing and services resources, foster a streamlined process at the local and state levels to fund and build housing opportunities more quickly, and standardize the state’s response to homelessness toward a focus on evidence-based housing and housing-based services solutions through long-term state and local structural changes.(n) It is the intent of the Legislature that racial disparities in the homeless population be eliminated by
        December 31, 2032.(o) Multinational corporations have been shifting income out of the California corporate tax base for decades. To recapture lost revenue on an ongoing basis, it is the intent of the Legislature to conform to certain provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code governing the taxation of corporations, as provided in the act adding this chapter.(p) It is further the intent of the Legislature to return corporate tax rates for the wealthiest corporations to historic corporate tax rates, as provided in the act adding this chapter, to save the lives of people experiencing homelessness and resolve one of the greatest moral crises of our state.13052.

(a) By January 1, 2025, the department shall seek federal approval for a Medi-Cal benefit to fund all of the following services for beneficiaries experiencing homelessness:(1) Housing navigation and housing acquisition support services.(2) Tenancy transition services.(3) Tenancy sustaining services.(4) Housing-based employment services.(b) The department shall convene a stakeholder advisory group representing counties, health care consumers, and homeless advocates in developing
      the plan.(c) The department shall work with counties to determine an effective process for funding the state’s share of the federal medical assistance percentage. Pursuant to an agreement with organizations representing California counties, the department may use up to 20 percent of the county-continuum allocation, as set forth under Section 13058, to pay for the state’s federal medical assistance percentage associated with the benefit identified in subdivision (a) for Medi-Cal beneficiaries experiencing homelessness.(d) The department shall pursue philanthropic funding to carry out the administrative duties of this section. The Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council may allocate a portion of the administrative funds, pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 13055, to create and pursue the plan in this section, and that portion shall equal no more than 1
      percent of the Bring California Home Fund.SECTION 1.The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:(a)In January 2019, an estimated 151,278 people experienced homelessness in California at a single point in time, as reported by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is the highest number since 2007, and represented a 17-percent increase since 2018. Experts predict significant increases in homelessness in 2021 resulting from the COVID-19 economic downturn.(b)African Americans are disproportionately represented among California’s homeless population. While 6.5 percent of Californians identify
    as Black or African-American, almost 40 percent of the state’s homeless population is African-American. Indigenous populations are over six times more likely to experience homelessness than the general population. Latinx Californians are least likely to access housing and services available in their communities.(c)Research suggests homeless populations are at far greater risk for consequences of COVID-19. Early studies estimated people experiencing homelessness are two to three times as likely to die from COVID-19 than the general population. COVID-19 is putting pressure on local homeless systems to open safe sites for people to shelter, in noncongregant settings, to avoid the spread of COVID-19.(d)Homeless is a statewide crisis in California which requires a
    statewide, comprehensive solution that meets its scale.(e)While California has made significant one-time investments in local homelessness solutions through the successful Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), Homeless Housing, Assistance, and Prevention (HHAP) Program, and Homekey program, multi-year, predictable investments are needed to support a sustained strategy.(f)The state must lead in coordinating with local governments and the private sector to solve homelessness and to prevent discharges from institutional settings into homelessness.(g)It is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to create a comprehensive, statewide homelessness solutions program. This program will fill gaps within the
    state’s response to homelessness, scale evidence-based solutions while promoting innovation to move people quickly into permanent housing, establish greater flexibility and a more nimble process in implementing a comprehensive response to homelessness, facilitate critically needed collaboration between different levels of government, foster a streamlined process at the local and state levels to fund and build housing opportunities more quickly, hold local governments and the state accountable for achieving results, and focus on evidence-based housing and housing-based services solutions and long-term state and local structural changes.(h)Furthermore, it is the intent of the Legislature that through the adoption of these strategies, the state and local governments will achieve measurable reductions in homelessness, ensuring that it becomes
    brief, rare, and nonrecurrent.(i)Furthermore, it is the intent of the Legislature to enact legislation to fund this comprehensive program with new, ongoing revenues of at least $2.4 billion per year from one or more of the following sources:(1)An increase in the personal income tax on incomes over $1 million.(2)An increase in the corporate income tax to historical rates, a more progressive corporate income tax, and conformity with the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the inclusion of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).(3)Eliminating or limiting corporate tax loopholes, including the water’s edge election.(4)Marking to market unrealized capital gains and the repeal of stepped-up in basis of inherited assets.SEC. 2.(a)The Bring California Home Fund is hereby created in the State Treasury for the purpose of providing at least two million four hundred thousand dollars ($2,400,000) annually to fund a comprehensive, statewide homeless solutions program upon appropriation by the Legislature.(b)The Bring California Home Fund shall contain revenues derived from any of following changes to the Personal Income Tax Law (Part 10 (commencing with Section 17001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code) or the Corporation Tax Law (Part 11 (commencing with Section 23001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code) that are enacted on
    or after the effective of the date of the act adding this section:(1)An increase in the personal income tax on incomes over one million dollars ($1,000,000).(2)An increase in the corporate income tax to historical rates, a more progressive corporate income tax, and conformity with the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the inclusion of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).(3)Eliminating or limiting corporate tax loopholes, including the water’s edge election.(4)Marking to market unrealized capital gains and the repeal of stepped-up in basis of inherited assets.
